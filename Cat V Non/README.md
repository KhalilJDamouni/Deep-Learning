# Cat V NonCat README

#### Testing DeepLearning with C. Trying without and with linear algebra operations to quantize vectorization performance improvements.

DeepLearning V0: Original "Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset_v6a" by deeplearning.ai in Python

DeepLearning V1: Translating "Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset_v6a" by deeplearning.ai from python to C

DeepLearning V2: Fixing V1, using less hardcoded values. Works for any size train and test set for 64,64,3 pictures.


> Comments:
> Near exact performance as python.
> Runtime calculations in V0 and V2. Will be run multiple times then calculate average for comparison.
